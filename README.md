# The example

We assume the following example: Contractors will install light poles. the spacing between poles are variable of interest/ Critical To Quality (CTQ), too much/little space between the poles will effect the lighting.

-   Target: 30 m

-   USL: 30.5 m

-   LSL: 29.5 m

there are 4 contractors.
